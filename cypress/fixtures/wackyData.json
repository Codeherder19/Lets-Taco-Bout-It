        "recipe": "Salsa de Aguacate\n==========\n\nThis is the traditional green sauce served from a Mexican taco cart. Very popular with Tacos al Past√≥r or Tacos de Canasta, it is a creamy, green sauce. It has avacado, but it by no means a guacamole. Usually available with other taco cart staples such as: sliced radishes, spicy salsa roja, fresh cilantro, and fresh limes.\n\n* 1/2 Kilo of Green Tomatillos (~1lb.)\n* 2 green Serrano peppers (optional for heat)\n* 1 avocado\n* 2 limes\n* 1/2 cup crema (Mexican sour cream, thinner and sweeter than standard sour cream)\n\nCook the tomatillos and peppers in a pot with water until soft. Drain the water out and let cool.\n\nPut tomatillos, peppers, salt, lime-juice, crema, and avacado (shelled and pitted) in blender. With lid on, blend until completely mixed and liquid consistency. Salsa should be the consistency of crema, liquid, yet slightly viscous.\n\nPour over your tacos liberally. Refrigerate between uses.\n\ntags: vegetarian\n",

In a medium bowl, mix together masa harina and hot water until thoroughly combined. Turn dough onto a clean surface and knead until pliable and smooth. If dough is too sticky, add more masa harina; if it begins to dry out, sprinkle with water. Cover dough tightly with plastic wrap and allow to stand for 30 minutes.\n2. Preheat a cast iron skillet or griddle to medium-high.\n3. Divide dough into 15 equal-size balls. Using a tortilla press (or a rolling pin), press each ball of dough flat between two sheets of wax paper (plastic wrap or a freezer bag cut into halves will also work).\n4. Place tortilla in preheated pan and allow to cook for approximately 30 seconds, or until browned and slightly puffy. Turn tortilla over to brown on second side for approximately 30 seconds more, then transfer to a plate. Repeat process with each ball of dough. Keep tortillas covered with a towel to stay warm and moist (or a low temp oven) until ready to serve.\n\ntags: vegetarian, vegan\n",
